# Crowfunding Mockup UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

A small project I did for practicing react, hmtl and css. It's a mockup of a crowfunding page where you can bookmark the shown project, and make donations of three different ranges.

-- It uses React Hooks and React state for improved functionality, it displays a small progress bar and is responsive for small devices only.
